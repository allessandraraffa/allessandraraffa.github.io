  <h1 class="blackheader"> The Reader</h1>
  <p> I'm wanting to stick to the theme of out-of-date website design for my reader. This theme is perfectly encapsulated by Oliver Burkemann's article "Stop trying to make the web look 'beautiful' – I've forgotten it already". <br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/oliver-burkeman-s-blog/2014/feb/04/facebook-paper-aesthetic-web-beautiful?key=72941">This text</a> is serving as the starting point for my reader. <br> <br> Below are excerpts of other texts that will be incorporated into this <br>final project:

<div class="blockonclick">
  You hear the word "beautiful" all the time, these days, when web design's being discussed. Medium, the blogging platform created by the Twitter co-founder Ev Wiliams, was conceived to be "simple [and] beautiful". Likewise Svbtle, another "beautiful" stripped-down publishing system, was designed to "get out of the way". This is the aesthetic of Jony Ive's iOS7, with its flat icons and defiant lack of adornment; it's an aesthetic for a world that does its reading on smooth pieces of black glass with curved corners. It's the aesthetic that's rapidly coming to dominate the web – which is why I feel some nervousness in poking my head above the parapet to say: what if I don't want my reading experience to be this beautiful?<br><br>

  Slippery Design defies balance and order, leads into the void and shows us worlds.
Slippery Design creates fields of meaning, mimeses in relationship, building lines to
oppositions. Slppry Dsgn masters the game of semiotic scraps; it speaks in syllables not
sentences. Slippery Design relies on dissemination through irritation, mutation,
failure ~ causes discourses to falter. Slippery Design is the true soul of the meme
, the virtuosity of any amateur.
This essay – a mind game with visual sketches – seeks a new approach to visual communication,
one appropriate to an era that negotiates itself through and with interdependent
ambiguities. Slippery Design is not a style, but a state of mind, a practice, a way of dealing
with cultural values and references, a form of writing and reading, a creator and at the same
time destroyer of myths. It lives in and through differences – always with the goal of
pushing towards controversial design.<br><br>

  The screech of dialup modems. Brightly colored, blinking text scrolling across a flickering screen. Web rings and under-construction GIFs and tinny Pearl Jam MIDIs.
For years, the 1990s Web has mostly been a set of punchlines for those who were online early enough to remember it, the virtual equivalent of JNCO jeans, Pogs and the Macarena.
But lately, a growing number of developers have sought to bring back its early aesthetic and, more importantly, the spirit of innovation and community they say prevailed on the Internet of the day. And that movement has spread to include programmers and designers who are too young to remember the ’90s but still admire the spirit of the early, less commercial web.<br><br>
