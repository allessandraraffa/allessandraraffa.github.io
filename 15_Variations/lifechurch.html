		History[edit]
		In January 1996, Life.Church began in Oklahoma City with 40 congregants meeting together "in a two-car garage, equipped with just a borrowed overhead projector and two construction lights purchased at Lowe's for $19.99."[4] From 1996 to 1999 the church membership grew rapidly. During this time, Life.Church acquired its first facility (now known as the "Oklahoma City Campus"). In 2001, MetroChurch, a 25-year-old, nondenominational church in nearby Edmond, Oklahoma joined with Life.Church, effectively making it a multi-site church. Following the success of the additional location, the church launched campuses in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Stillwater, Oklahoma in 2002, and these new campuses began incorporating satellite video teaching into their services.[5]

		Life.Church opened an additional campus in OKC, the South Oklahoma City Campus, in Spring 2005. In February 2006, Life.Church introduced a campus in Fort Worth, Texas. In April, the church established its "Internet Campus," which broadcasts weekly, interactive worship services live over the internet. In July, the church also launched a new campus in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[6]

		Easter Sunday, 2007, Life.Church began broadcasting from their new campus in the online game Second Life.[7][8][9]

		Life.Church also decided to do away with "church membership", deciding instead to encourage people to become "partners" in helping lead people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. The church has developed a Bible application for mobile phones, YouVersion. Introduced in 2008, it has been described as "[t]he world's most popular Bible program for mobile phones."[10]

		Life.Church features a casual dress code and most attendees wear jeans and casual clothing,the dress code as quoted by pastor Craig Groeschel is "Please Do", the worship service includes refreshments before and after the services, music style is pop-rock and praise-worship, with the performances amplified concert style and lyrics shown on projector.
