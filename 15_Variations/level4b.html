			<b> 42. </b>Avoid fields. Jump fences. Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory regimes are attempts to control the wilding of creative life. They are often understandable efforts to order what are manifold, complex, evolutionary processes. Our job is to jump the fences and cross the fields.

<div class="text">


		Love your experiments (as you would an ugly child). <br>
		Joy is the engine of growth. <br>
		Exploit the liberty in casting your work as beautiful experiments, iterations, attempts, trials, and errors. <br>
		Take the long view and allow yourself the fun of failure every day. <br>
    Be careful to take risks. <br>
		Time is genetic.<br>
		Today is the child of yesterday and the parent of tomorrow.<br>
		The work you produce today will create your future.<br>
		Make your own tools.<br>
		Hybridize your tools in order to build unique things.<br>
		Even simple tools that are your own can yield entirely new avenues of exploration.<br>
		Remember, tools amplify our capacities, so even a small tool can make a big difference.<br>
Stand on someoneâ€™s shoulders.<br>
You can travel farther carried on the accomplishments of those who came before you.<br>
And the view is so much better.<br>
Listen carefully.<br>
Every collaborator who enters our orbit brings with him or her a world more strange and complex than any we could ever hope to imagine.<br>
By listening to the details and the subtlety of their needs, desires, or ambitions, we fold their world onto our own.<br>
Neither party will ever be the same.
